    title: "Racism is the other virus sweeping America during this pandemic",

    My parents have seen it all. As Japanese Americans, they experienced as children the pain of internment during World War II, one of the terrible scars in our country's past that stemmed from fear, hate and racism. They lived through the horrors of 9/11 and witnessed the discrimination against Muslims in the wake of those attacks. With the coronavirus pandemic today, they are hearing the all-too-familiar vitriol toward Asian Americans being spewed from the dark and angry corners of social media and beyond.

    Although they remained stoic and largely reserved in the decades that followed internment, their quiet resilience changed dramatically after 9/11. They would begin to speak out against the injustices of that time, becoming activists in their own right.

    Now, as a Chicagoan who for nearly two decades worked for the Chicago Department of Public Health, I can't remain silent as I witness the bigotry that has percolated in Chicago and across the country in response to the novel coronavirus pandemic that began in Wuhan, China. Racism has its own virulence that is bad for the nation's soul and, as research has shown, is actually bad for the nation's health.

    My family's path to the Midwest began in those internment camps. In order to leave, family members secured employment in Chicago. Despite prejudice and fear among many Chicago businesses and their employees, my grandparents and parents were given opportunities at Wrap-on Tools and Edgewater Beach Hotel. My grandparents became valuable, dependable and loyal employees and challenged their children to excel too.

    Given a chance, my parents thrived, both finishing high school and going on to college. My dad joined the Army and then went to dental school on the GI Bill. My mom became a high school art teacher. They were resilient and didn't dwell on the past, raising their children with strong values, including sacrifice and service to others. My parents' influence is a key reason I chose my career path in public health and now work at a foundation that advocates for a fair and just opportunity for everyone in America.

    But my parents were spurred to action after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. As fear, discrimination and violence toward Muslims increased, they spoke out against these injustices. In recent years, they raised their voices again as federal policies became more punitive and restrictive for immigrants and refugees. Normally soft-spoken and unassuming, my parents shared their experiences in panel discussions, newsletters and as featured guests of a multimedia exhibit depicting the internment of Japanese Americans, "Then They Came for Me."

    The resilience I learned from them has buoyed me and my three brothers, as we too have experienced racism, including crude and hateful remarks. My parents taught us to turn the other cheek, to be confident in our identity and values, no matter the situation.

    Now, I must speak out in the face of new attacks on Asian Americans. A preliminary analysis examined nearly 1 million tweets focused on racial minorities between November 2019 and March 2020 — the period when the novel coronavirus went from outbreak to pandemic. The percentage of tweets involving negative speech against Asian Americans increased 70% during that period while falling 4% for all other racial minority groups.

    This treatment of Asian Americans is immoral, but also dangerous to public health. Research shows that hateful speech and other actions against racial and ethnic minorities — even seemingly small slights — might make people sick, contributing to heart disease, respiratory illness and other chronic diseases. In an environment where people of any race feel threatened, they might be less likely to seek treatment out of fear and distrust of our medical system. This is especially dangerous in the midst of a pandemic when we should be lowering barriers to care, not raising them.

    During and after this pandemic, we must treat Asian Americans not as enemies, but as fellow victims of this insidious virus that does not distinguish by place, race, age or gender. This is the time to support our neighbors, not turn on them. These are the values that define our nation.

    John of the Cross, a 16th-century Catholic priest and mystic, wrote that "In the evening of our lives we will be judged only by how we have loved." As a nation, we will be judged now by how we treat people in need. That's a lesson I learned from my parents, and a value I carry proudly in my work and everyday life.

    In this time of the novel coronavirus, we are all in need of understanding, compassion and love. This is good for the soul, and for the health of our nation.

    Ro Nguyen thought it would play out differently.

    The 30-year-old had just watched a movie at a Streeterville cinema with a friend on March 12 and was strolling down East Grand Avenue around 8 p.m., the two of them marveling at the deserted streets.

    As they headed toward the Red Line station, Nguyen said a man walking nearby saw them and yelled out, "F--- China!" Then the man spat on Nguyen, splattering saliva onto his jacket.

    Nguyen, who is of Vietnamese and Filipino descent, had imagined this moment. Having read news stories about harassment and attacks against Asians as coronavirus cases rose, he wondered if he would be next. But when it happened, he and his friend hurried away in shock.

    Nguyen said he believes former President Donald Trump's use of the term "Chinese virus" stoked such reactions. Although Trump later stressed support for Asian Americans, Nguyen fears the damage was already done.

    Across the U.S., reports of hate crimes surged, from New York to San Francisco. In California, a 16-year-old boy was hospitalized after being beaten and accused of having the coronavirus.

    State Rep. Theresa Mah said Chinese Americans recognize they may be scapegoated during times of uncertainty.

    ---

    "History is repeating itself."

    Mabel Menard, a 58-year-old Chinese American, recalled a drunk man at a tavern asking, "Do you have the corona?" She dismissed him with humor, and he was removed.

    Tuyet Anh, a DePaul University student, described being whispered about on the Red Line as men suggested putting on masks near her. She later saw social media posts using terms like "Chinese virus" and "Wu flu," saying it made Asian Americans feel "as if we are the virus."

    Menard compared the climate to the Chinese Exclusion Act and Japanese internment, saying: "History is repeating itself."

    Asian American groups launched #WashTheHate, gathering more than 400 incident reports within a week. Police noted no official rise in hate crimes but urged reporting.

    ---

    Businesses hit hard.

    In Chicago's Little Vietnam, Ellen Dong noticed customers disappearing even before Illinois' stay-at-home order. She worries anti-China rhetoric is hurting livelihoods.

    This year, Dong said, reflects the paradox of Asian American identity: invisible until there is someone to blame.

    "Asians are forgotten until— and I don't know why— until there's something to blame. Then we remember them."

      "Trump alienating Asian Americans: Riling up his base seems to outweigh reaching minorities",

    Sonny Vinuya hasn’t decided if he’ll vote again for Donald Trump in the battleground state of Nevada.

    The Filipino American businessman in Las Vegas is personally offended by the president’s use of racist slurs at recent reelection rallies, where Trump mocked China and the origins of COVID-19 in Asia. Yet for Vinuya, the economy remains the most important factor, even as it sinks into a pandemic-triggered recession.

    Although it is difficult for the registered Republican to ignore derogatory remarks targeting his own community, Vinuya said he does not believe Trump intends to alienate Asian American voters when using terms like “Chinese virus.”

    The Pew Research Center recently declared Asian Americans the fastest-growing racial or ethnic group in the U.S. electorate. However, they remain one of the least competitive voting blocs for Trump due to their geographic distribution and political affiliation patterns.

    In Nevada, Asians account for more than 10% of voters in a closely contested state. According to AAPI Data founder Karthick Ramakrishnan, Trump appears to be prioritizing his base of older white voters over outreach to Asian American communities.

    Asian Americans largely live in non-competitive states, with one-third residing in California alone.

    Trump’s rhetoric has angered many Asian Americans and drawn criticism from Joe Biden, Barack Obama, and even some Republicans such as Kellyanne Conway. White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany defended Trump, saying he was merely identifying the virus’s origin.

    Since COVID-19 took hold, advocates have reported a rise in anti-Asian aggression. Stop AAPI Hate documented 832 incidents in California over 12 weeks. Biden condemned Trump’s rhetoric as xenophobic, emphasizing that presidential words matter.

    Asian American alignment with Democrats has increased over two decades while GOP support has declined. A 2018 Pew analysis found Democrats holding a 2-to-1 advantage among Asian American voters.

    Most Asian ethnic groups viewed Trump unfavorably, except Vietnamese Americans—62% held a favorable view in 2018. Only 14% of Japanese Americans reported the same.

    In states with the largest Asian American electorates, Trump won only Texas and Florida in 2016. But in smaller states like Nevada, where Asian Americans make up about 11% of voters, they could influence the outcome.

    Trump lost Nevada in 2016 by 2.4 percentage points. The state now leans more blue.

    As president of the Las Vegas Asian Chamber of Commerce, Vinuya has been courted by the Trump campaign. He acknowledges he could influence the president’s reelection prospects. He voiced concerns about anti-Asian rhetoric, especially as he supports 600+ Asian American business owners facing stigma and discrimination.

    “I gave them my two cents,” Vinuya said. “I don’t want to waste my time on something I cannot control.”

    Hundreds of people huddled with signs reading "#StopAsianHate" on Saturday afternoon at Chinatown Square in Chicago’s latest protest against anti-Asian racism. The rally followed a shooting spree across Atlanta-area spas that left eight dead, six of them women of Asian descent.

    The event was led by the Chinatown Security Foundation and the Coalition for a Better Chinese American Community, with more than 65 Asian American organizations involved.

    Other protests throughout the week also drew hundreds of participants, including a Friday night vigil at Horner Park.

    Julie Moy, an 18-year-old from McKinley Park, and her 15-year-old cousin joined after seeing a rally notice in Chinatown Square. Moy said, “There aren't many rallies against Asian hate, and it needs to be more of a thing.” Her cousin Jason added that supporting the community felt important, especially following the Georgia killings.

    The March 16 massacre deepened the wounds of a community already facing scapegoating during the COVID-19 pandemic. Recent months saw additional incidents of violence against Asian Americans nationwide, including a local attack still under investigation.

    The rally honored three Asian American men killed in Chicago last year: Weizhong Xiong, 38, and Huayi Bian, 37, fatally shot in a Chinatown parking lot; and Shuai Guan, 33, killed in Bridgeport.

    Chris Huang, president of the Chinatown Security Foundation, discussed adding security cameras but stressed that anti-Asian prejudice has deep historical roots: “This attitude of Asians being looked down on has been here since my grandfather worked on the railroad in the early 1900s.”

    Grace Chan McKibben of CBCAC called the event part of a growing movement demanding visibility and action. She noted the heightened awareness of racism and sexism following the Georgia shootings.

    Nancy Chen, a 76-year-old AARP Illinois council member, led the crowd in chanting “Enough is enough,” expressing fears shared by many elderly Asian Americans.

    Nationally, anti-Asian hate crimes rose by 149% last year, despite an overall decline in hate crimes. A coalition of Asian organizations documented 3,795 incidents between March 2020 and February, with 70% reported by women.

    Organizers presented five demands: enhance safety in Chinatown; ensure timely and culturally sensitive responses; create a hate-crime reporting website; mandate Asian American history in public schools; and fund community organizations.

    Illinois officials including Grace Hou, Kim Foxx, and Toni Preckwinkle attended. Foxx criticized former President Trump for rhetoric promoting “white supremacy” and affirmed ongoing prosecution efforts: “We will seek justice and accountability.”

    Moy and Jason were surprised and encouraged by the turnout, noting both the size and diversity of the crowd.

    title: "Atlanta shootings have left scars in Chicago's Chinatown",
    author: "Yin, Alice",

    text: `
    Chicago's Chinatown leaders gathered Thursday to send a message that the Asian American community will stand strong in the aftermath of a shooting spree across three Atlanta-area spas that left eight people dead, six of them Asian women. Yet leaders also acknowledged that over the past year, fear has deeply affected the community.

    Hong Liu, executive director of the Midwest Asian Health Association, said Chinese residents have been flooding the organization's mental health clinic seeking treatment for stress, anxiety, and even suicide attempts. Many say they are afraid to go outside to exercise or go to work, while small business owners have been closing earlier out of fear.

    “We've got to work together to stop the crime, to stop the violence, and stop the anti-Asian hate crime,” Liu said. “In the past year, there is an increasing number of hate crimes and killings, threatening not only our safety and life but also our mental health.”

    The gathering followed Tuesday's shootings across two spas in Atlanta and one in its suburbs. The attack was the latest in a series of assaults on Asian Americans during a year of heightened violence. Robert Aaron Long, a 21-year-old white man, has been charged with murder.

    Ald. Byron Sigcho-Lopez said the pandemic—first identified in China and labeled the “China virus” by former President Donald Trump—fueled increased racism against Asian Americans. He emphasized that anti-Asian bias is longstanding and must be confronted as part of a larger system of white supremacy.

    His comments echoed Mayor Lori Lightfoot, who said the Atlanta attack “felt like a hate crime.” Public outrage grew after Georgia officials claimed the suspect’s actions stemmed from a “sex addiction” rather than racial motives.

    A national coalition has documented 3,795 racist incidents against Asians from March 2020 to February, including 92 in Illinois, with almost 70% reported by women.

    David Wu of the Pui Tak Center said many immigrants in his English classes see their own lives reflected in the Atlanta victims—working long hours in service jobs and facing scapegoating during the pandemic.

    “Our students feel very traumatized,” Wu said. “Whether or not they've been direct victims, many feel shame and fear.”

    Chicago police Cmdr. Don Jerome noted that although reports have not increased, many Chinatown residents may hesitate to contact police. Additional patrols were announced for Asian American neighborhoods.

    Grace Chan McKibben said that even without a major attack in Chicago, racism remains present: “People look at us with suspicion, as if we are a walking virus.”

    She added: “But we do not have to live in fear. We must live in strength and in power.”

    When Summer Chen talks about her life in Chicago, there is a sorrow that tinges her feelings toward the city she calls home. It is where she has found her calling as a Mandarin teacher, but it has also been the site of repeated racist harassment—from criticism of her accent to sexual messages and online intrusions filled with slurs.

    After the Atlanta spa shootings that left eight people dead, Chen said she feared for her safety more than ever: “What if the next victim is me?”

    Asian American women say the tragedy revived lifelong memories of racism tied to misogyny, a pattern rooted in centuries of discriminatory laws and sexual stereotyping.

    During her school’s remote learning sessions, Chen said teenage intruders shouted slurs such as “Chinese [expletive]!” The experience traumatized her: “Every time I open the classroom link, the fear returns.”

    Reports of anti-Asian incidents surged during the pandemic, with nearly 70% coming from women. The Atlanta victims included Soon Chung Park, Hyun Jung Grant, Suncha Kim, Yong Ae Yue, Delaina Ashley Yaun, Paul Andre Michels, Daoyou Feng, and Xiaojie Tan.

    For many women, the violence echoed personal experiences. Sung Yeon Choimorrow described racialized sexual harassment as a distinct and persistent form of harm. She recalled a man shouting slurs at her downtown: “It retraumatizes you every time.”

    Other women spoke about being groped, verbally harassed, or targeted online. Scholar Sara Zhang emphasized that the racism predates Trump-era rhetoric, tracing its roots to the Page Act of 1875, the Chinese Exclusion Act, and U.S. military presence in Asia.

    The “model minority” myth further obscures Asian American struggles, said Lan Ho, who argued it discourages society from recognizing racism even after the Atlanta killings.

    Authorities initially downplayed racial motives, but advocates strongly rejected those claims. Grace Pai said: “He targeted three Asian businesses and killed mostly Asian women. How is that not racial?”

    Advocacy groups have been training bystanders and pushing for legislation requiring Asian American history in schools. Rep. Theresa Mah emphasized recognizing Asian Americans’ full humanity beyond stereotypes.

    At a large “Stop Asian Hate” rally, Chen addressed the crowd, including her 8-year-old son. Speaking through years of accumulated pain, she also felt pride: “I am proud to be an Asian woman. I don’t want my children to grow up in fear.”

    Reading the latest news, I remain silent while my dumbfounded friends, teachers, and mostly white family gasp at reports of rising anti-Asian violence. COVID-19 has intensified discrimination, but for me, Asian hate is not new. What weighs heavily on my mind now are the children of the victims—many of them multiracial, born in America, and overlooked in conversations about racism.

    A 2015 Pew study found nearly half of multiracial Americans were under 18. A generation of children is experiencing racism their parents may not understand. I can. When a boy at school shouted, “How are you going to see the road through those eyes?” I told him it was racist—but afterward, I felt utterly alone. That is what it means to be multiracial in America.

    At home, my Jewish mother tried to relate, but I longed for my Chinese father, who died when I was 7. Maybe seeing his face would have helped me embrace my features—my slender eyes, flat nose, soft jawline. Yet even if both parents were there, they couldn’t change the loneliness: neither is multiracial.

    Author Peter Ho Davies writes that biracial identity is not the two sides of the hyphen but the hyphen itself—a “third alternative” that is equally authentic. Mine combines Chinese food on Rosh Hashanah and matzo-ball-wonton soup at Thanksgiving. Still, I feel guilt for not attending Chinese school, for knowing more about my Jewish side, for feeling closer to my bubbe than my nai nai.

    Multiracial individuals have long faced discrimination. Light-skinned Black Americans have historically felt pressured to “pass” as white while navigating accusations from their own communities—tensions even Kamala Harris faced. Research shows mixed-race people experience higher rates of mental health struggles and substance abuse.

    Hollywood attempts representation through mixed-race characters in shows like “Grown-ish” and films like “Crazy Rich Asians,” but often whitewashes at the expense of honoring biracial identity. Society sees only my Chinese features and tells me to check one box—Asian. Maybe two: Caucasian and Asian.

    But identity is not binary. Multiracial people cannot be simplified into a single category. Society must stop reducing us to what we look like. Identity runs deeper. America must acknowledge the “third alternative”—the hyphen. Our identities are complex, multilayered, and imperfectly mixed—and that is our truth.

    A year ago, Lunar New Year celebrations unfolded as COVID-19 began spreading globally, ushering in a new wave of anti-Asian bias stoked by then-President Trump and xenophobic rhetoric. As another Lunar New Year arrives, vaccines offer hope against the virus but not against the racism that has escalated into violence, particularly toward elderly Asian Americans.

    Incidents include the murder of 84-year-old Vicha Ratanapakdee in San Francisco, a subway slashing of a 61-year-old Filipino man in New York, and several assaults against older Asians in Oakland’s Chinatown. Sam Hyun of the Massachusetts Asian American Commission noted troubling silence from media and officials during early spikes in hate incidents.

    Stop AAPI Hate recorded 67 reports from Massachusetts between March 19 and Dec. 31, 2020. Nearly 90% involved verbal harassment; 7.5% involved coughing or spitting; 3% physical assaults. Examples include taunts such as “You will infect us,” accusations of spreading COVID-19, and children bullying Asian classmates.

    Most incidents fall outside current hate crime statutes, said Russell Jeung, calling for expanded civil rights enforcement. A bill to reform Massachusetts' hate crime law is pending. Attorney General Maura Healey urged residents to report hate crimes.

    The state's Asian American Commission has created a reporting system and released resources, including a manual for responding to anti-Asian violence. While extreme violence seen elsewhere hasn’t been reported locally, the psychological toll remains significant. Older residents fear leaving home, said Boston Councilor Ed Flynn.

    Advocates emphasize bystander intervention due to victims' reluctance caused by distrust of law enforcement, language barriers, or immigration concerns. President Biden condemned anti-Asian racism in a Lunar New Year message, labeling it “a stain on our national character,” and signed an executive order directing stronger DOJ action.

    Jessica “Jay” Wong, interim executive director of the Asian American Commission, stressed that Asian communities need vocal, active support from local leaders to feel safe and not alone.

    Fears of the coronavirus have fueled rising anti-Chinese sentiment online as traditional slurs and new terms such as “kungflu” conflate the pandemic with national and ethnic identity. Social media researchers documented surging hostility and expressed concern that online hate is spilling into real-world incidents of harassment, violence, and boycotts of Asian-owned businesses.

    Joel Finkelstein of the Network Contagion Research Institute said that online rhetoric operates like a virus, leading to visible actions. His team found increases in conspiracy theories and anti-Chinese content on 4chan’s “Politically Incorrect” board and on Twitter, including posts urging violence against Asians.

    A second research group, involving scholars from multiple countries, found sharp rises in anti-Chinese slurs on 4chan and milder increases on Twitter, especially during the outbreak in Wuhan and after President Trump used the term “Chinese Virus” on Twitter. While the researchers did not attribute causation directly, they said Trump’s comments were a legitimizing moment for bigoted language.

    Beyond the Internet, experts warn that anti-Chinese rhetoric has real-world consequences. Russell Jeung of San Francisco State University said normalizing such slurs dehumanizes Asians, making them scapegoats. Jeung documented patterns in which xenophobic statements preceded boycotts of Asian businesses and then interpersonal attacks.

    Stop AAPI Hate, launched by Jeung and community partners, has recorded more than 1,100 incidents targeting Asian Americans since its creation. Reports include spitting, verbal abuse, and physical assault. Examples include a San Francisco woman spat on by a stranger yelling expletives about China, and an Asian woman in New York struck with an umbrella after passengers accused her of causing the coronavirus.

    Yang Zhang, a co-author of the international study, said he was shocked by the intensity of hateful language online, which he views as a reflection of real-world hostility.

    Psychologist Charissa Cheah emphasized that terms like “kungflu” draw from long-standing racist tropes. The pandemic, she said, has not created anti-Asian bias but amplified existing prejudices.

    Further evidence of rising sentiment includes spikes in hashtags like #BlameChina, #ChinaLiedPeopleDied, and #ChineseVirus, which surged to nearly 130,000 uses the day after Trump used the phrase. Researcher Darren Linvill noted platform differences: 4chan content is overtly racist, while Twitter posts often carry a political tone.

    Twitter stated it enforces zero-tolerance policies for threats, harassment, and hateful conduct. After defending the phrase “Chinese Virus,” President Trump later urged people to “protect our Asian American community” and stopped using the term in public.
